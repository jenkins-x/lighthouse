## JenkinsSpec

JenkinsSpec holds optional Jenkins job config

| Stanza | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `branch_source_job` | bool | No | Job is managed by the GH branch source plugin<br />and requires a specific path |

## PipelineRunParam

PipelineRunParam represents a param used by the pipeline run

| Stanza | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | No | Name is the name of the param |
| `value_template` | string | No | ValueTemplate is the template used to build the value from well know variables |

|---|---|---|---|
| `decorate` | bool | No | Decorate determines if we decorate the PodSpec or not |
| `path_alias` | string | No | PathAlias is the location under <root-dir>/src<br />where the repository under test is cloned. If this<br />is not set, <root-dir>/src/github.com/org/repo will<br />be used as the default. |

| `skip_submodules` | bool | No | SkipSubmodules determines if submodules should be<br />cloned when the job is run. Defaults to true. |
| `clone_depth` | int | No | CloneDepth is the depth of the clone that will be used.<br />A depth of zero will do a full clone. |
| `name` | string | Yes | The name of the job. Must match regex [A-Za-z0-9-._]+<br />e.g. pull-test-infra-bazel-build |
| `labels` | map[string]string | No | Labels are added to LighthouseJobs and pods created for this job. |
| `annotations` | map[string]string | No | Annotations are unused by prow itself, but provide a space to configure other automation. |
