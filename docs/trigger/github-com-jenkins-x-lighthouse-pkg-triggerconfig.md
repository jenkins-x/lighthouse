## Config

Config represents local trigger configurations which can be merged into the configuration

| Stanza | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | string | No | Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.<br />Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.<br />Cannot be updated.<br />In CamelCase.<br />More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds<br />+optional |
| `apiVersion` | string | No | APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.<br />Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and<br />may reject unrecognized values.<br />More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources<br />+optional |
| `name` | string | No | Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although<br />some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name<br />automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration<br />definition.<br />Cannot be updated.<br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names<br />+optional |
| `generateName` | string | No | GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique<br />name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided.<br />If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different<br />than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.<br />The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,<br />and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value<br />unique on the server.<br /><br />If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will<br />NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason<br />ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client<br />should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).<br /><br />Applied only if Name is not specified.<br />More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency<br />+optional |
| `namespace` | string | No | Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is<br />equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation.<br />Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for<br />those objects will be empty.<br /><br />Must be a DNS_LABEL.<br />Cannot be updated.<br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces<br />+optional |
| `selfLink` | string | No | SelfLink is a URL representing this object.<br />Populated by the system.<br />Read-only.<br /><br />DEPRECATED<br />Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned<br />to be removed in 1.21 release.<br />+optional |
| `uid` | [UID](./k8s-io-apimachinery-pkg-types.md#UID) | No | UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by<br />the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT<br />operations.<br /><br />Populated by the system.<br />Read-only.<br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids<br />+optional |
| `resourceVersion` | string | No | An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can<br />be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic<br />concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources.<br />Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server.<br />They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.<br /><br />Populated by the system.<br />Read-only.<br />Value must be treated as opaque by clients and .<br />More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency<br />+optional |
| `generation` | int64 | No | A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.<br />Populated by the system. Read-only.<br />+optional |
| `creationTimestamp` | [Time](./k8s-io-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1.md#Time) | No | CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was<br />created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations.<br />Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.<br /><br />Populated by the system.<br />Read-only.<br />Null for lists.<br />More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata<br />+optional |
| `deletionTimestamp` | *[Time](./k8s-io-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1.md#Time) | No | DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This<br />field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not<br />directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible<br />from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the<br />finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.<br />Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the<br />future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.<br />For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react<br />by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,<br />the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,<br />remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still<br />exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the<br />resource is fully terminated.<br />If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.<br /><br />Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.<br />Read-only.<br />More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata<br />+optional |
| `deletionGracePeriodSeconds` | *int64 | No | Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before<br />it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set.<br />May only be shortened.<br />Read-only.<br />+optional |
| `labels` | map[string]string | No | Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize<br />(scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers<br />and services.<br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels<br />+optional |
| `annotations` | map[string]string | No | Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be<br />set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not<br />queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.<br />More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations<br />+optional |
| `ownerReferences` | [][OwnerReference](./k8s-io-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1.md#OwnerReference) | No | List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have<br />been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller,<br />then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true.<br />There cannot be more than one managing controller.<br />+optional<br />+patchMergeKey=uid<br />+patchStrategy=merge |
| `finalizers` | []string | No | Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry<br />is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry<br />from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries<br />in this list can only be removed.<br />Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced<br />because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.<br />finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.<br />If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation<br />in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is<br />waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a<br />component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.<br />Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and<br />are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.<br />+optional<br />+patchStrategy=merge |
| `clusterName` | string | No | The name of the cluster which the object belongs to.<br />This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters.<br />This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.<br />+optional |
| `managedFields` | [][ManagedFieldsEntry](./k8s-io-apimachinery-pkg-apis-meta-v1.md#ManagedFieldsEntry) | No | ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields<br />that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal<br />housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or<br />understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a<br />controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like<br />"ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the<br />workflow used when modifying the object.<br /><br />+optional |
| `spec` | [ConfigSpec](./github-com-jenkins-x-lighthouse-pkg-triggerconfig.md#ConfigSpec) | Yes | Spec holds the desired state of the Config from the client<br />+optional |

## ConfigSpec

ConfigSpec specifies the optional presubmit/postsubmit/trigger configurations

| Stanza | Type | Required | Description |

| `presubmits` | [][Presubmit](./github-com-jenkins-x-lighthouse-pkg-config-job.md#Presubmit) | No | Presubmit zero or more presubmits |
| `postsubmits` | [][Postsubmit](./github-com-jenkins-x-lighthouse-pkg-config-job.md#Postsubmit) | No | Postsubmit zero or more postsubmits |
